## About The Exercise

My intention is show some skills in fullstack development, the code is conformed in backend and frontend 
and it's include some important topics like concurrency, Model-View-Controller, API-Rest, PostgreSql, Docsting and OpenApi specifications.

I think that is a small project and covers some of the necessary knowledge to deploy a microservice in a production environment.
